# recommending-lines-reproduce-package

This reproduce package is created for paper "Where Should I Look at? Recommending Lines thatReviewers Should Pay Attention To".

## Description

There are two main parts in our work. The first part is data process(see data_process folder) part to process the raw dataset and generate csv files. 
We implement the experiment for this part with Python, Jupyter notebook for IDE and Conda for environment.
The second part is data evaluation(see data_eval folder) part to evaluate the experiment result with csv files generated in previous step. We use R and R studio for IDE in this part.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

## System dependencies
* For data process part, we use Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS
* For data evaluation part, we use macOS Big Sur (11.3)

## Package dependencies
Data Process(Python)  | Data Evaluation(R)
------------- | -------------
sklearn  | Content Cell
numpy  | Content Cell

### Installing

* For data process part, we save our conda environment file in env folder. Create the new env with file:
* ```
* conda env create -f environment.yml
* ```
* It will install all dependencies need for the experiment.
